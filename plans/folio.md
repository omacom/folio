# Folio: Omarchy's own file manager

## Why

Omarchy ships Nautilus, and Nautilus hard-depends on LocalSearch, GNOME's indexer. The first time someone opens the file manager, LocalSearch starts crawling all of `$HOME`, model weights and build trees included, and opens every file it can parse in-process. On 2026-11-10 that crashed `localsearch-extractor-3` (SIGSEGV in gupnp-dlna's audio profile guesser) on an audio file. On Hyprland it buys little: faster Nautilus search and full-text search, both of which Omarchy users rarely reach for.

Nautilus is also the one big GTK app in an otherwise Qt Quick and terminal desktop. It doesn't follow the Omarchy theme the way the shell and the Omarchy apps do, and its extension points (nautilus-python) are how Omarchy bolts on LocalSend and transcoding.

Folio replaces it with an app built the way Hype, Monologue, Omacut and Signed are: C++ and Qt Quick, one window, keyboard-first, following the theme and language live, installed as a package.

## Principles

- **Nothing in the background.** No indexer, no crawler, no daemon. Folders are listed when opened, thumbnails are made when a tile needs one.
- **Share with the desktop, don't duplicate it.** Thumbnails go in the freedesktop cache (`~/.cache/thumbnails`) using the installed thumbnailers. Remote and removable storage go through GVfs/GIO. Search by name uses the `plocate` database Omarchy already maintains.
- **Airy and quiet.** Design 1 ("Places") from the design canvas: sidebar, breadcrumbs, a roomy grid with real previews, a preview pane. Square corners unless Hyprland rounds windows; colors from the whole Omarchy palette.
- **Keyboard first, mouse friendly.** Every action has a key; `?` lists them.
- **Careful with data.** Never destroy without a way back: delete means trash, every file operation can be undone, conflicts are asked about, never silently overwritten.
- **Say what's wrong.** A failed mount, a missing thumbnailer or a permission error shows in the window.

## Where it stands

Done, tested, and verified offscreen:

- Folder model listing off the UI thread, folders first, natural sort, hidden files toggle, live reload on change.
- Grid tiles show size (or item count) and date under the name; no status bar.
- Folder tiles as plain cards, selection shown as color on the item itself; file tiles with real thumbnails (in-process for common images, installed thumbnailers for video, PDF, HEIC, office files), drawn stand-ins otherwise.
- Shared thumbnail cache per the spec, with failure markers so broken files aren't retried.
- Sidebar sections Views (Recents from GTK's recently-used.xbel, Trash with Restore, Delete Permanently and Empty Trash per the freedesktop spec, details showing origin and deletion date); Tab moves the keyboard between sidebar and files.
- Right-click menus everywhere (Open, Open With, Preview, Rename, Duplicate, Copy, Cut, Paste, Copy Path, Compress, Share via a Dropbox link, LocalSend or Taildrop, Pin, Terminal, Delete to trash); clipboard interoperable with GNOME/KDE apps; pastes never overwrite.
- Sort by name, kind, newest, oldest or size.
- Split view (Ctrl+Alt+N, Ctrl+W closes): two folder panes side by side, each with its own path, history and selection; sidebar and details follow the active pane. New windows (Ctrl+N) open in the running process.
- Multi-select: Shift+click/arrows for ranges, Alt+click to add or remove, rubber band on empty space, Ctrl+A; file actions and drags act on the selection.
- Path entry (Ctrl+L): ~ and relative paths, a file selects itself in its folder, Tab completes folder names.
- `/` searches this folder and every folder below it by name as you type: a live breadth-first walk, nearest first, that stays on the folder's drive and doesn't follow symlinked folders.
- Three views, remembered between launches: grid (Ctrl+1), list with name, size and date (Ctrl+2; no headings; the date then the size step aside when narrow), and Finder-style columns (Ctrl+3).
- Preview pane: large preview, the system's type name, size, modified, dimensions, opening lines of text files, Open.
- Sidebar: a Home section (its label goes home) listing every folder in home (XDG folders and Dropbox with their own glyphs, `omarchy` shown as Omarchy); Pinned folders (Ctrl+D or drag onto the sidebar) stored as GTK bookmarks; Dropbox (with `dropbox-cli` sync status), Trash, physical drives (removable and extra internal disks, not the system's own), online tailnet machines from `tailscale status --json`.
- Tailnet machines open over SFTP through GIO, landing in the matching home folder; their host keys are accepted without asking (Tailscale already checked the peer), and a password, when keys aren't set up, is asked in the window.
- Mouse back/forward buttons move through history (in the preview: previous/next file).
- Space opens a large preview in its own process (`folio preview`), like Sushi: pictures at full size with zoom, animated GIF/WebP, video and audio playing (Qt Multimedia's FFmpeg backend), PDFs scrolling (Qt PDF), text and rendered Markdown, folders with their pictures, and the largest cached thumbnail for anything else. Arrows step through the folder and the grid follows; a crash in the preview is reported in the Folio window. Ctrl+I toggles the details pane.
- `org.freedesktop.FileManager1` for "Show in folder"; `folio <file>` opens its folder with the file selected.
- `folio chooser`: other apps' Open and Save dialogs, as `xdg-desktop-portal`'s FileChooser backend (`share/folio.portal`, started by D-Bus). A dialog is a Folio window with a bar along the bottom: the name to save under, the app's filters and choices, and the answer. Opt-in through `portals.conf` until Omarchy names it.
- Whole-palette theme following, Hyprland rounding, the Omarchy translator, `?` overlay.

## Phases

### 0. Foundations (from the Codex review, before file operations)

- Identify files by GIO URI rather than local path, so SFTP, MTP and Trash entries behave the same as local ones once operations exist.
- Design operation safety first: the queue, undo log and conflict handling in phase 1 build on it.
- Run thumbnailers in a separate, resource-limited process, the way the preview already runs apart.
- Thumbnail cache fixes: validate `Thumb::URI` on a cache hit and version the failure directory (`fail/folio-<version>`).
- Responsiveness: summarize subfolders lazily (visible tiles first), and move `details()` off the UI thread.

### Previews, finishing the Sushi replacement

- Office documents: LibreOffice headless conversion to PDF, cached under `~/.cache/folio/previews`, thumbnail shown while it converts.
- Fonts: a sample sheet. Archives: the file list from `bsdtar -tf`.
- Syntax highlighting for code (KDE syntax-highlighting) and better Markdown spacing.
- PDF search (Ctrl+F) and text selection with copy.
- A window rule in Omarchy floating `folio-preview`, the way `org.gnome.NautilusPreviewer` floats today.

### 1. File operations (makes it usable as a daily driver)

- An operation queue in C++ on a worker thread: progress in the window, cancel, and a conflict prompt (replace, keep both, skip, apply to all).
- Undo and redo (Ctrl+Z / Ctrl+Shift+Z) for rename, move, copy, trash and new folder.

### 2. Finding things

- Type-to-filter in the current folder (instant, no index).
- Search everywhere by name with `plocate`, scoped to the current folder and below, with a live fallback walk for folders `updatedb` doesn't cover (new files, mounts).
- No full-text search. If it's ever wanted, it runs on demand (`rg` under the current folder), never as an index.

### 3. Actions menu

- `:` opens the actions menu from design 3, filtered as you type: Compress, Extract, Copy path, Open terminal here, Open with…, Send with LocalSend, Transcode, Set as background, Send to a tailnet machine (Taildrop).
- These replace Omarchy's nautilus-python extensions (`localsend.py`, `transcode.py`) by calling the same commands (`localsend`, `omarchy-transcode` through `omarchy-launch-floating-terminal-with-presentation`).
- Actions are plain data (label, MIME filter, command) so Omarchy can add its own without code changes, from a directory under `$OMARCHY_PATH` and one under `~/.config/folio`.

### 4. Remote and removable storage

- Tailnet machines' first-connection host key question is accepted automatically (Tailscale already authenticated the peer); other servers are asked, and GVfs shows their fingerprint as "???", so show the real one (from `ssh-keyscan`) next to the question.
- Unmount and eject (removable drives, SFTP mounts) from the sidebar.
- Taildrive shares listed under their machine once the tailnet's ACLs grant `drive:share`/`drive:access`; mounted as WebDAV through GVfs.
- SMB/NFS/MTP keep working through the GVfs backends Omarchy already installs (`gvfs-smb`, `gvfs-nfs`, `gvfs-mtp`); MTP phones appear under Devices.

### 5. Agents and scripts

- `folio list|info|thumbnail|trash|restore` with `--json`, no display needed, exit 0/1, errors on stderr, following Hype's `src/cli.cpp`.
- `folio skill install` installs a short agent skill bundled in the binary.

### 6. Shipping in Omarchy

- Repository `omacom/folio`, tagged releases, package in `omacom/omarchy-pkgs` under `pkgbuilds/folio/` with an upstream watch.
- `install/omarchy-base.packages`: add `folio`; drop `nautilus`, `nautilus-python` and `sushi` once the previews phase is done (`folio preview` covers Sushi's job). Keep the `gvfs-*` backends.
- Rename `bin/omarchy-launch-nautilus` and `-cwd` to `omarchy-launch-file-manager` and `-cwd`, keeping the old names as wrappers for a release; update the Super+Shift+F bindings, `omarchy-theme-bg-install`, `omarchy-install-gaming-retroarch`, the menu example, and the `omarchy dock` example.
- Make Folio the default for `inode/directory` in Omarchy's mimeapps defaults.
- Window rules: replace `org.gnome.Nautilus` and `org.gnome.NautilusPreviewer` with `folio` where a rule should still apply (transparency, floating).
- Dropbox: `omarchy-install-service-dropbox` stops adding `nautilus-dropbox`; Folio shows sync status itself.
- `install/config/theme-system.sh` links Nautilus action icons; drop it with the extensions.
- A migration for existing installs: install Folio, set the default, and offer (not force) removing Nautilus, since some people will want to keep it.
- Until Folio ships, mask LocalSearch for every user (`/etc/systemd/user/localsearch-3.service` → `/dev/null` from `omarchy-settings`, plus a migration), so Nautilus stops crawling home folders now.

### 7. Polish that's part of done

- Translations for all 50 Omarchy languages, `.desktop` `Name[...]`/`Comment[...]` included; check long words in Danish and German, and right-to-left in Arabic.
- Screen-reader names on every control; full keyboard reach of the sidebar (Ctrl+F6 cycles panes).
- Large-folder performance: 50,000 entries listing in under a second locally, thumbnails never blocking scrolling, SFTP folders listing progressively.
- Real audio waveforms or embedded cover art instead of the decorative stand-in; video durations from `ffprobe` on the preview pane.

## Open questions

- **File chooser as the default.** `folio chooser` is there; Omarchy's `hyprland-portals.conf` would name it (`org.freedesktop.impl.portal.FileChooser=folio`), the package would install `share/folio.portal`, the D-Bus service and `folio-chooser.desktop`, and a window rule would float `folio-chooser`. Dialogs don't yet attach to the window that asked (xdg-foreign), so they float on their own.
- **Nautilus as an option.** Offer `omarchy-install-nautilus` for people who want it back (with LocalSearch masked)?
- **Thumbnail sizes on HiDPI.** Request `x-large` (512) on scaled outputs, or keep `large` and accept softer tiles?
