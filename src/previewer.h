// The state behind `folio preview`: the file being looked at, its siblings
// to step through, and which viewer shows it. It runs in its own process, as
// Sushi does for Nautilus, so a video or PDF that crashes a decoder takes the
// preview window down, never the file manager.
//
// Talks to the Folio window that started it over stdin and stdout, one path
// per line: Folio writes the item selected in its grid, the preview writes
// the item it steps to, and each side follows the other. ↑ and ↓ are written
// as "step -1" and "step 1": rows belong to the folder view, so Folio moves
// its selection, sends the new item back, then "stepped". Arrows pressed
// before that wait for it: taken from the old item, they'd undo the move.
